# Py-Glasses

Py-Glasses are me trying to use python and openCV to create a sort of smart glasses thing.
This is the varient where i am using object detection to do things. There is another repository wher there is a text overlay as a sort of HUD.


This will mainly be centred around a VR headset (The type you put your phone into) and a Raspberry Pi zero W

Ideas so far:
- Use camera(s) on the front of the headset to relay the live images to a webpage,
- The webpage will display the images in the correct format for the phone to see and use in the headset,
- Information will be added to those images,
- And object detection will be used to point out things like stop signs, other people etc.


- Once this is all working, i will try to encorporate my python vitual assistant into it,
- This will probably be controlled by a ring (or something like it) with a joystick.

you will need to download some things in some places, in the folder is a README.md file, it will contain the links to anything you may need to download.

I do not think that there are any requirements.txt files, however there may be, if you are getting import errors, let me know and i can let you know what you need to pip install, otherwise just google the errors.
